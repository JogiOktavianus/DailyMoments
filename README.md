Simple Core Data Project

This app is result of my NC 3 Challenge on Apple Developer Academy @IL where i explore about Core Data and CollectionView to DailyMoment's.

## Overview and Story behind
I'm taking to gain more knowledge about Core Data, it come from MC3 i got assisgned by my team as coder when my major in academy is as a Design. So in this MC 3 my team already design how the apps gonna look like, and yeah we need Core Data to maximize the apps become more better, when is user can insert about they're journey, adding photo, text, and also date. But in MC3 all of this design and code was not so good, i ask my friend to help get rid about the core data. So basically that is done by my friend, not me. So in this NC 3 i want to learn more and more about the Core Data, so yeah that's why i take this topic for me.

## Core Data
Core Data is a framework that you use to manage the model layer objects in your application. It provides generalized and automated solutions to common tasks associated with object life cycle and object graph management, including persistence.

Core Data typically decreases by 50 to 70 percent the amount of code you write to support the model layer. This is primarily due to the following built-in features that you do not have to implement, test, or optimize:
1. Change tracking and built-in management of undo and redo beyond basic text editing.
2. Maintenance of change propagation, including maintaining the consistency of relationships among objects.
3. Lazy loading of objects, partially materialized futures (faulting), and copy-on-write data sharing to reduce overhead.
4. Automatic validation of property values. Managed objects extend the standard key-value coding validation methods to ensure that individual values lie within acceptable ranges, so that combinations of values make sense.
5. Schema migration tools that simplify schema changes and allow you to perform efficient in-place schema migration.
6. Optional integration with the applicationâ€™s controller layer to support user interface synchronization.
7. Grouping, filtering, and organizing data in memory and in the user interface.
8. Automatic support for storing objects in external data repositories.
9. Sophisticated query compilation. Instead of writing SQL, you can create complex queries by associating an NSPredicate object with a fetch request.
10. Version tracking and optimistic locking to support automatic multiwriter conflict resolution.
11. Effective integration with the macOS and iOS tool chains.

## Contribution
This is an ongoing project that might help you (and also me) to learn about Core Data and CollectionView design pattern, so if you think you can make this project even better by adding more feature or maybe redesign the design and make become more better just go a head, just make pull request at this repo and let's learn together! ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©
